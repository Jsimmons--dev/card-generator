{"rarity":"rare","theme":"Celestial Empires","cardType":"Celestial Artifacts","cardName":"Eclipse Core","prompt":"Create a detailed piece of fantasy art depicting a rare Celestial Artifact called the Eclipse Core. This artifact looks like a radiant orb emitting both sunlight and moonlight, with swirling, glowing patterns of gold and silver. It is suspended in the middle of a cosmic nebula, with vibrant stars and distant galaxies in the background. Surround the artifact with ethereal, fading rings representing eclipses and include small, glowing runes orbiting it. The art should evoke a sense of ancient power and cosmic wonders, with a focus on the mystical and awe-inspiring nature of the artifact."}
