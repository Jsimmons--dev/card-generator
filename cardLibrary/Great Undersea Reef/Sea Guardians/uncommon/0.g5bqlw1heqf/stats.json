{"rarity":"uncommon","theme":"Great Undersea Reef","cardType":"Sea Guardians","cardName":"Poseidon's Sentinel","prompt":"Create a stunning underwater scene depicting Poseidon's Sentinel, an uncommon Sea Guardian card in the Great Undersea Reef theme. The sentinel is a majestic figure, part human and part aquatic creature, with an imposing trident made of coral and sea gems. The sentinel's body shimmers with blue and green scales, and he is surrounded by glowing jellyfish and vibrant schools of fish. The backdrop includes colorful coral reefs and ancient underwater ruins, all bathed in the soft, refracted light filtering through the ocean surface above. The overall atmosphere should be mystical and protective, showcasing both the beauty and the mystery of the underwater world."}
