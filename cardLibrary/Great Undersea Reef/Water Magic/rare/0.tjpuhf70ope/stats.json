Depict the Abyssal Tidelord, a majestic and powerful water mage. The Tidelord is surrounded by swirling currents of glowing blue energy, with exotic marine creatures like jellyfish and seahorses dancing in the water around it. The Tidelord's form is part human and part sea creature, with flowing robes that look like cascading water and a trident that channels ancient oceanic powers. The background showcases colorful coral formations and shimmering light filtering through the ocean depths. The overall style should be dynamic and mystical, capturing the awe-inspiring power and beauty of underwater magic."}
