{"rarity":"uncommon","theme":"Mystic Swamp","cardType":"Hidden Groves","cardName":"Whispering Alder Clearing","prompt":"A hidden grove within a mystical swamp, surrounded by towering ancient alder trees whose bark glows with soft bioluminescence. The mist drifts lazily above a shallow, clear pond filled with lily pads and floating firefly-like spirits. Vines and moss drape from the branches, and the grove is partially illuminated by ethereal, glowing blue and green plants. In the center of the clearing is an old, moss-covered stone altar, with runic carvings itnahalf-hidden by nature's reclaim. The atmosphere is serene yet mysterious, with whispering echoes hinting at old enchantments."}
