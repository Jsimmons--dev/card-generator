The creature is partially shrouded in the swamp's mist, with a lithe, elongated body covered in bioluminescent scales that pulse with soft light. The eyes of the creature glow an eerie green, and it has webbed limbs with clawed digits. The swamp around it is filled with glowing plants, ancient, twisted trees, and dark, murky waters. The art style is dark and vibrant fantasy, with elements of glowing plants, eerie lighting, and mystical symbols intertwined with the swamp's natural elements. This is a full art image with no text."}
