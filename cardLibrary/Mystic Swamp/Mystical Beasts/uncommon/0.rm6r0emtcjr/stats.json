{"rarity":"uncommon","theme":"Mystic Swamp","cardType":"Mystical Beasts","cardName":"Glimmering Nightstalker","prompt":"Create an image of an uncommon mystical beast in a swamp setting. The creature is a Glimmering Nightstalker â€“ a lithe, half-reptilian, half-insectoid creature with bioluminescent markings along its scales and wings. It has six legs and a long, slender neck ending in a beady-eyed, curious face. The Nightstalker is shown emerging from the misty swamp, with glowing plants and eerie, ancient trees surrounding it. The scene should feel mysterious and enchanting, with a dark and vibrant fantasy art style, capturing the mystical and eerie ambiance of the swamp environment."}
