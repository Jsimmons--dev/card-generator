{"rarity":"common","theme":"Mystic Swamp","cardType":"Swamp Spells","cardName":"Luminescent Mist","prompt":"A dark, enchanting swamp landscape at twilight, shrouded in rolling mist that glows with faint luminescent light. Ancient, gnarled trees with bioluminescent fungi cling to their bark are scattered throughout. Strange, magical symbols faintly hover in the air, blending into the mist. The water of the swamp is murky but has patches where soft, greenish-blue light emanates from beneath, suggesting hidden magical sources. The atmosphere is eerie yet whimsical, with small, glowing fireflies dancing through the air."}
