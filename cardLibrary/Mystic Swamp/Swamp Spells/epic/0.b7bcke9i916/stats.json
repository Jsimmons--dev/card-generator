{"rarity":"epic","theme":"Mystic Swamp","cardType":"Swamp Spells","cardName":"Vortex of the Ancient Mist","prompt":"Epic fantasy art depicting a mystical swamp shrouded in thick, swirling mist illuminated by an ethereal green glow. At the center, a powerful vortex of arcane energy spirals upwards, pulling in wisps of enchantment from the swamp's ambient magic. Glowing runes are etched in the vortex's spinning core, surrounded by ancient trees with eerie, dark bark and bioluminescent algae hanging from their branches. The water beneath shimmers with an otherworldly light, and small magical creatures can be seen peeking out of the mist. The atmosphere is both enchanting and foreboding, capturing the raw, magical power of the swamp."}
