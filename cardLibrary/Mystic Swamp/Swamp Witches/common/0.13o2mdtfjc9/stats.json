{"rarity":"common","theme":"Mystic Swamp","cardType":"Swamp Witches","cardName":"Swamp Witch Apprentice","prompt":"A young swamp witch standing knee-deep in a mist-covered swamp. The witch wears simple, tattered robes and a basic pointed hat made of woven reeds. She holds a wooden staff with a small glowing crystal at the tip. Surrounding her are common swamp plants and small, friendly swamp creatures like fireflies and frogs. The setting is mysterious yet modest, with an enchanting glow from the plants reflecting off the water. The art style is dark and vibrant fantasy with lots of mystical symbols intertwined with natural elements."}
