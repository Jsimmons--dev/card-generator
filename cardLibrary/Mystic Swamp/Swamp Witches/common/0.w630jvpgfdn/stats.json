In the center, a whimsical swamp witch is gathering herbs by a shimmering pond. She is dressed in tattered, earthy robes adorned with various plant elements. Her face is partially hidden by a moss-covered hood, and she holds a glowing mushroom in one hand while inspecting a strange root with the other. Ethereal fireflies dance around her, illuminating her peaceful surroundings. The swamp is shrouded in a magical mist, with vibrant fungi and bioluminescent flowers scattered around."}
